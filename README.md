# Particle-Swarm-Optimization-PSO-Algorithm
Particle Swarm Optimization implementation-

The PSO algorithm which is a famous Nature Inspired Computing algorithm is implemented from scratch on attached data set. The optimal regression coefficients were obtained and was compared by applying PSO.

To run this notebook use Jupyter Notebook App and make sure data set is in the same directory: 

1- The easiest way to install the Jupyter Notebook App is installing a scientific python distribution which also includes scientific python packages. The most common distribution is called Anaconda,
Download Anaconda Distribution (a few 100MB), Python 3, 64 bits. Install it using the default settings for a single user. Try to avoid MS Explorer for downloading.

2-The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows):

command- jupyter notebook

This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open.
